# Summary of Past Work
When a police officer pulls over a car, they can either give the offending individual a warning or a citation. The reasons they may do either are multitude. Some reasons, such as if the driver is not sober, are well founded and acceptable. Other reasons, such as the driver's race or sex, are not. The data I used in these graphics came from the police department records for the state of **INSERT STATE HERE**. The data was messy and massive, with over 1.6 million entries. As such, I trimmed the factors that I was interested in down to whether the individual's race, their sex, whether alcohol was present, the season the stop was performed in, and whether the stop was conducted during the day shift or night shift. Whether they should have or not, each of these factors contributed to the individual receiving a violation or a warning. In this story I will **FIXE ME HERE**

This data set is massive. In order to be able to show the relationship between each factor, I will be displaying them using mosaic plots. Unfortunately, as there is so much information, I have had to split the data into four sections, displayed in the plot below. A critical split is on whether there was alcohol involved in the traffic stop. As you can tell by the plot below, there are many more entries with no alcohol present than the alternative. This plot is given to show how each of the subsequent plots fit in together. Each plot could be placed inside its respective intersection to show the relationship. Unfortunately, that would be illegible.
